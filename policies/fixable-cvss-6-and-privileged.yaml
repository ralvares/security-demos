  rationale: Known vulnerabilities make it easier for adversaries to exploit your
    application, and highly privileged containers pose greater risk. You can fix these
    high-severity vulnerabilities by updating to a newer version of the affected component(s).
  remediation: Use your package manager to update to a fixed version in future builds,
    run your container with lower privileges, or speak with your security team to
    mitigate the vulnerabilities.
