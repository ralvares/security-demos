  rationale: Use of package managers at runtime indicates that new software may be
    being introduced into containers while they are running.
  remediation: Run `dpkg -r --force-all apt && dpkg -r --force-all debconf dpkg` in
    the image build for production containers. Change applications to no longer use
    package managers at runtime, if applicable.
