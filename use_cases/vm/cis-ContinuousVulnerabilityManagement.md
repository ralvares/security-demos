## The CIS-Driven Vulnerability Management Program (VMP)

**Framework Reference:** CIS Control 07 (v8): *Continuous Vulnerability Management*

This program is built on four distinct "Workstreams" that move the customer from a **state of fear** to a **state of measurement.**

### 1. The Inventory Baseline (CIS Control 7.1)

**Goal:** You cannot secure what you haven't identified.

* **The Rule:** Maintain a clear list of every container image authorized to run in the cluster.
* **The Action:** Create a "Namespace Registry." Every OpenShift project must have a designated **Technical Owner**.
* **The "Now What?":** If the tool finds a vulnerability, identify the owner. If no owner exists, the container is unauthorized (CIS 7.1) and should be decommissioned.

### 2. Automated Vulnerability Scanning (CIS Control 7.5)

**Goal:** Use the tool for continuous discovery.

* **The Rule:** Perform automated scans of all software at least weekly (or more frequently).
* **The Action:** Schedule automated scans to run continuously across all environments (Dev, Test, Prod).
* **The "Now What?":** Review the "Top Risk" dashboard every Monday morning. This is your **"Weekly Security Pulse."**

### 3. Risk-Based Triage (CIS Control 7.2)

**Goal:** Stop chasing every CVE and focus on the "Killers."

* **The Rule:** Prioritize remediation based on the risk to the enterprise.
* **The Action (The Filter):** Use a **3-Tier Filter** to decide what to fix:
1. **Severity:** Is it a 9.0+ CVSS (Critical)?
2. **Exploitability:** Is there a "Known Exploit" in the wild?
3. **Fixability:** Is there an available patch or newer version?


* **The "Now What?":** If a CVE meets all three, it moves to the **Urgent Path**. Everything else is secondary.

### 4. The Remediation (CIS Control 7.7)

**Goal:** Define the "Time-to-Remediate" and the path to closure.

* **The Action (The SLA):** The organization must agree on these windows:
* **Critical Risk:** Fix within **3 to 7 Days**.
* **High Risk:** Fix within **30 Days**.


* **The Closure Paths:** Every finding must end in one of three ways:
* **Path A (Patch):** Developer updates the image/code.
* **Path B (Mitigate):** The team "shields" the app (e.g., Network Policies or SCCs).
* **Path C (Accept):** A business leader signs off on the risk for a set time period.


* **The "Now What?":** If a "Critical" persists past Day 7, it is escalated as a **Policy Violation**.

## Summary

> "The tool is the **thermometer**; it tells you that you have a fever. This CIS-driven program is the **doctor**; it’s the process that decides what medicine to take and when you’re healthy enough to go back to work.
> By following the **Triple Filter**, we turn 5,000 alerts into 5 actionable tasks."
